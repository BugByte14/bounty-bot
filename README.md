# Bounty Bot
A levelling discord bot I developed for use on the [scallywags discord server](https://discord.gg/scallywags).

## Features
* Counts messages users (except bots) send.
* Counts time spent in VCs.
* Allows users to check current xp and level.
* Allows users to see how much xp is needed for next level and the amount left.
* Allows users to see most wanted list (still work in progress).
* Allows admins to manually set the level of a user.
* Stores user levels in database so information is secure in event of crash.
* Sends pirate-themed level-up message in the #bounties channel.

## Planned Features
* Automatically assign a most wanted role to user with highest bounty.
