# Bounty Bot
A levelling discord bot I developed for use on my discord server.

## Features
* Counts messages users (except bots) send.
* Allows users to check current xp and level.
* Allows users to see how much xp is needed for next level and the amount left.
* Allows admins to manually set the level of a user.
* Sends pirate-themed level-up message in the #bounties channel.

## Planned Features
* Count time users spend in VCs.
* Store each user's level so it won't be lost if bot goes offline.
* Automatically assigned a most wanted role to user with highest bounty.
*
